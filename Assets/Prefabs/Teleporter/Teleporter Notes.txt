Teleporter works by randomly placing the transporter in front of the reciever then moving on player collision.
This continues until the playe has traveled a certain distance, known as Infinite Road Length, a value in the SceneManager's counting script.

Problem I forsee with this for the chase scene: you don't want to see the car popping into existance randomly. 
If the car is hot on your tail and you go through the telepoerter before it, itll look like you're alone for a few seconds.
Consider using this trick for the space in between story beats rather than the chase.
