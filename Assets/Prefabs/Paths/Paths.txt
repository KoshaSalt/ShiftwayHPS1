(Road Creator)
The "Road Creator" prefab is our road. It is a bezier path that is generated between nodes which can be transformed.
You can drop it into a scene and begin working on a road. Add nodes with shift+click. Remove nodes with ctrl+click.
Editing the shape of the road is memory intensive and causes the scene view to lag heavily. But, the road itself is fairly lightweight.
Even when stretched to a couple thousand unity long (as it is now), the mesh does not seem to cause and perfomance issues in play mode.

(Road Mesh Holder)
The graphical component of the road is delt with in the "Road Mesh Holder". It contains two materials for the road, one top and one bottom.
Texture tiling and overall road widths however is managed in a script on the Road Creator game object. 
The object should generate it's own Road Mesh holder, but in the event it doesn not, take the prefab here.
The road mesh holder is finnicky as hell and often does not update the shape and location of the mesh collider after making changes to the road.
I just go Mesh Collider -> Remove Component, Add Component -> Mesh Collider after I make a significant change to the road.

(Default road settings as of 7/15)
Road Width: 12
Thickness: 0.5f
Texture tiling: 100
